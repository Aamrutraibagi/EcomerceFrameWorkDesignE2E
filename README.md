# EcomerceFrameWorkDesignE2E
Hybrid Robust E2E Frame work using Maven Build Management Tool, which include POM Design Pattern,Test NG Java Frame work, Test Data Driven Frame work, Cucumber BDD, and Data Driven Using JSON, Excel File.
#
🔺 Scenario: Handling Reusablity Class
1. Used Abstarct class for all Selenium Reusable methods like Waiting methods, common page navigation, Scroll methods and we can also use them for Windows handling, Alert handling, Switching Frames reused in POM classes by the help of Inheritance concept
2. Used Base Class for taking screen shot, Data Reader method for parsing JSON to Hash Map, Before and After Method's also maintained reused in Test case's by the help of Inheritance concept
#
🔺 Scenario: Handling Flaky Tests

To address flaky tests, I would implement retry logic in TestNG. By using the retryAnalyzer feature in TestNG
#
🔺 Scenario: Parallel Execution

TestNG allows running tests in parallel, either at the suite or test level, by organizing them into different suites and configuring parallel attributes like "parallel" and "thread-count".

<suite name="MyTestSuite" parallel="tests" thread-count="5">
<!-- Test configurations -->
</suite>

#
🔺 Scenario: Data-Driven Testing

TestNG supports data-driven testing through its @DataProvider annotation, which allows me to supply test data from external sources such as Excel sheets or JSON.

@DataProvider(name = "loginData")

public Object[][] getLoginData() {

return new Object[][] {

{"user1", "pwd1"},

{"user2", "pwd2"},

}
}

@Test(dataProvider = "loginData")

public void loginTest(String username, String password){}

#
🔺 Scenario: Grouping and Tagging Tests

TestNG allows grouping tests using the @Test(groups) annotation, enabling selective execution and better organization of test suites by defining groups in testng.xml. This allows for selective execution of tests and better organization of test suites like smoke, sanity, regression.

@Test(groups = {"smoke", "regression"})

public void loginTest() {

// code

}

#
🔺 Scenario: Taking Screen shot on Test failure

I have return the take screen shot method in Base class that also gives path of file and using TestNG listners class I called the takescren shot method in OnTestFailure method by this way I can take screen shot on test failure

#
🔺 Scenario: Report Generating

For Generating Report I used Extent Report and Extent Spark Reporter here we can customize the Report also.
